MET DATA NOTES  -- for excel file 'combined_2014-2016-v2'


Temp, precip, & RH data:
From CRN 
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/qcdatasets.html
https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/daily01/
Temp was converted from C to K.
Precip was categorized as snow if temp<=0 degrees C and rain if temp>0 degrees C.
snow = rain*1.3


Wind speed data (350cm height):
From mini met towers @ polygons (Bob Busey @ UAF):
http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov/data/#fq=datasource%3A%22NGEE%20Arctic%22&q=busey
originally hourly averages, converted to daily averages.  Data is from mini met-tower in Area C.
note: A lot of 0.45 values between 20160110 and 20160222

alternative source for wind speed data (ARM):

Radiation data:

shortwave:
From ARM
http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/fcat::radio/fsrc::armobs,armderiv,extobs,extderiv/fsite::nsa
*REMEMBER TO ADD d_sw_hem + d_sw_diff to get shortwave radiation

longwave:
From mini met towers @ polygons (Bob Busey @ UAF):
http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov/data/#fq=datasource%3A%22NGEE%20Arctic%22&q=busey
originally hourly averages, converted to daily averages.  Data is from mini met-tower in Area C.



Units:
